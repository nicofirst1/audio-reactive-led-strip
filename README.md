# Audio Reactive LED Strip
Real-time LED strip music visualization using Python and the ESP8266 or Raspberry Pi.

## Installing the Python dependencies
Install python dependencies using apt-get
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-pyaudio
```

## Audio device configuration
For the Raspberry Pi, a USB audio device needs to be configured as the default audio device.

Create/edit `/etc/asound.conf`
```
sudo nano /etc/asound.conf
```
Set the file to the following text
```
pcm.!default {
    type hw
    card 1
}
ctl.!default {
    type hw
    card 1
}
```

Next, set the USB device to as the default device by editing `/usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf`
```
sudo nano /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf
```
Change
```
defaults.ctl.card 0
defaults.pcm.card 0
```
To
```
defaults.ctl.card 1
defaults.pcm.card 1
```


## Configure the visualization code
In `config.py`, set the device to `'pi'` and configure the GPIO, LED and other hardware settings.
If you are using an inverting logic level converter, set `LED_INVERT = True` in `config.py`. Set `LED_INVERT = False` if you are not using an inverting logic level converter (i.e. connecting LED strip directly to GPIO pin).
